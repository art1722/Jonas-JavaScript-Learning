overview here we have the Maclaurin series for e to the X simply put this is a polynomial that approximates e to the X better and better the more terms you include if I just graphed y equals these first two terms then we get a tangent line approximation which is only a good approximation for X values close to zero but the important thing to know is that this function and e to the X have the same first derivative and Y value at x equals zero if I go out to a third term we get a parabola that is an even better approximation to e to the X around zero and this function and e to the X have the same first and second derivative just at x equals zero if I go to four terms the approximation gets even better and as we keep going including more and more terms the approximation keeps improving although I'll stop at eleven terms if I were to go on forever we would get a perfect approximation and the curves would look the exact same the general equation for the series looks like this and all this is is a polynomial whose derivatives at some x equals a will match those of your original f of X when a is zero which means your approximation is centered around that x value like we see here we have a Maclaurin series when we move that center point to anywhere else then this is called a Taylor series for our
